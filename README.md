F28WP Web Programming

One of the coursework in my Web Programming module requires me to create a Github repository and do regular commits. To achieve full marks, I am expected to write clear and concise code and be able to demonstrate all of the skills listed here: https://hackmd.io/@jufyzdslTuqXiBCKUiA96g/Syh8H5FkT

This repository has a home page - Hello, F28WP - which will contain a list of projects that I work on for this coursework and any other information.
